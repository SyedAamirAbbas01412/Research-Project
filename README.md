**Diabetic Disease Classification with Hybrid and Blending Models**
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a classification system for diabetic disease using advanced machine learning echniques.
We propose three system models, including two hybrid models and one blending model, to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, training deep learning models, and evaluating their performance through rigorous validation techniques.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have:
  Google Colab or any Python-based environment
  Necessary Python libraries installed, such as:
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    TensorFlow or PyTorch
    Matplotlib and Seaborn
    SHAP

Steps to Run
        Mount your Google Drive in Colab or set up your local environment for the dataset.
        Preprocess the dataset with scaling and class balancing techniques.
        Train the proposed system models (two hybrid models and one blending model).
        Evaluate the models using metrics and K-fold cross-validation.
        Visualize feature importance using SHAP for interpretability.
